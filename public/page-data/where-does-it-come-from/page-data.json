It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\n","date":"2021-09-07T18:51:32"}},"pageContext":{"__typename":"WpPost","id":"cG9zdDoxNA==","databaseId":14,"uri":"/where-does-it-come-from/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
